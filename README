# lstree
A simple ls-like tool to recursively display directories and sub-directories and their contents.
It can show file and directory access permissions, modes, and ownership just like `ls` only
in a nice colorful manner.

# INSTALLATION

1.) `git clone https://github.com/yo-kai-sei-shin-kage/lstree.git`
2.) `cd lstree`
3.) `chmod u+x lstree.sh`
4.) `cp lstree.sh /usr/bin/lstree`

# USAGE

Use lstree in the same way you would the standard `ls` command.
user@linux: lstree /path/to/directory
user@linux: lstree

# Future Add-ons

Will be adding support for colorized display of file and directory properties
such as permissions, read-only, executable, extension types, etc.

# DISCLAIMER

This tool is released to the public in the hopes that it will be useful. I am
not responsible for anything that you do with this tool or anything that happens
while using this tool. It is a basic bash shell script. Not much else to it.

# NOTES

Play with the code and see what you can do with it. Fork if you wish to add
your own features.
